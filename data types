In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. Python infers the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it. Here are some commonly used data types in Python:

1. Numeric Types:
int: Integers, e.g., x = 5
float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., y = 3.14
complex: Complex numbers, e.g., z = 2 + 3j

2. Sequence Types:
str: Strings, e.g., name = "John"
list: Ordered and mutable collections of items, e.g., my_list = [1, 2, 3]
tuple: Ordered and immutable collections of items, e.g., my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

3. Mapping Type:
dict: Collection of key-value pairs, e.g., my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

4. Set Types:
set: Unordered and mutable collection of unique items, e.g., my_set = {1, 2, 3}
frozenset: Unordered and immutable collection of unique items, e.g., my_frozenset = frozenset({1, 2, 3})

5. Boolean Type:
bool: Boolean values True or False, e.g., is_valid = True

6. None Type:
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value, e.g., x = None

7. Sequence Types (Binary):
bytes: Immutable sequence of bytes, e.g., b = b"hello"
bytearray: Mutable sequence of bytes, e.g., ba = bytearray(b"hello")

8. Other Data Types:
datetime: Represents dates and times, e.g., import datetime; dt = datetime.datetime.now()
function: Represents a function, e.g., def my_function(): pass; f = my_function
Type Conversion:
You can convert between different data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.

Dynamic Typing:
Variables in Python can change types as different values are assigned to them. For example:

python
Copy code
x = 5      # x is an integer
x = "hello"  # now x is a string
